      <p>Hi! My name is Lydia Young. If you immediately think of Beetlejuice or At The Circus, we'll be great friends! &quot;I, myself, am strange and unusual.&quot;</p>

      <p>I was born and raised in Colorado and I'm proud to call this state home! I share my house with four furry babies - two dogs, Finnegan McFlufferson and Deke Bombay, and two cats, Apollo and Ada Lovelace. I enjoy traveling and I have racked up my air-miles the last several years visiting different states across the continental US and up into Canada, down to Mexico. (I'm hoping to add Europe to the list soon!)</p>

      <p>I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and recently began teaching myself coding. I'm currently in a programming bootcamp to learn fullstack development and will graduate in April.</p>
